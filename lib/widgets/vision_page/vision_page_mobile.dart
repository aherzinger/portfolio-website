When I was about 10, I was already trying to figure out how it could be possible to end poverty and world hunger. Furthermore I thought about how it would be possible to connect people from different countries, cultures, etc.\n
These 2 thoughts stuck in my mind ever since they first came up, and I am trying to implement them in my private and also in my working life.\n
I try to do that by doing what I love and what I am best at. I think a scientific mind with sharp coding skills will eventually result in innovation, therefore that's what I am trying to aquire.\n''',
